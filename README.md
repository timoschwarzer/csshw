# csshW
_Cluster SSH tool for Windows inspired by [csshX](https://github.com/brockgr/csshx)_

![csshw demo](https://github.com/whme/csshw/blob/84570f8dd767e17df0027f11a19e5e3276718787/demo/csshw.gif)[^1][^2]

## Pre-requisites
- A working [WSL-2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) installation [^3]
- ``Default terminal application`` is set to ``Windows Console Host`` in the windows Terminal Startup Settings (Windows 11 only)

## Overview
csshW consist of 3 executables:
- ``csshw`` - a launcher that starts the daemon application and serves as main entry point
- ``csshw-daemon`` - spawns and positions the client windows and propagates any key-strokes to them
- ``csshw-client`` - establishes an SSH connection and replays key-strokes received from the daemon

csshW will launch 1 daemon and N client windows (with N being the number of hosts to SSH onto).<br>
Key-strokes performed while having the daemon console focussed will be sent to all clients simoultaneously and be replayed by them.<br>
Focussing a client will cause any key-strokes to be sent to this client only.

## Download/Installation
csshW is a portable application and is not installed.<br>
To download the csshW application refer to the [Releases üì¶](https://github.com/whme/csshw/releases) page.

## Contributing
csshW uses pre-commit githooks to enforce good code style.<br>
Install them via ``git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/``.

Symlinks for the debug version of each executable are placed in the project root for easy debugging.
Format, build and execute debug version:
```
cargo fmt; cargo build; if ($?) { .\csshw.exe foo bar }
```

## Available/Verified configurations

Config path `%AppData%\csshw\config\client-config.toml`

- Using WSL2 with `ubuntu` (‚úîÔ∏è):
    ```
    ssh_config_path = '%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config'
    program = 'ubuntu'
    arguments = [
        'run',
        'source ~/.bash_profile; ssh -XY {{USERNAME_AT_HOST}} || [[ $? -eq 130 ]]',
    ]
    username_host_placeholder = '{{USERNAME_AT_HOST}}'
    ```

- Using git for windows `git-cmd.exe` (‚ùî):
    ```
    ssh_config_path = '%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config'
    program = 'git-cmd.exe'  # make sure its in your path
    arguments = [
        '--command',
        'C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe -XY {{USERNAME_AT_HOST}}'
    ]
    username_host_placeholder = '{{USERNAME_AT_HOST}}'
    ```

[^3]: WSL-2 is the only console application that supports writing to its input buffer.<br>
Other application I tried include ``ssh``, ``git-bash``, ``windows cmd`` and ``windows powershell``.
